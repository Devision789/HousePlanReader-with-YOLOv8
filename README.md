## Introduction

Reading and interpreting house plans is a critical task in the fields of architecture, construction, and real estate. This project aims to develop an efficient and accurate system to automate the process of reading house plans using YOLOv8.

## Features

- Real-time detection and interpretation of house plan elements
- High accuracy with YOLOv8
- Easy to integrate with various applications
- Supports custom datasets of house plans
- Flexible and customizable detection conditions

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Devision789/HousePlanReader-with-YOLOv8.git

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

To run the house plan reading application, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py --source /path/to/your/house/plans --weights /path/to/best/weights
```

### Customization

You can customize the application by modifying the configuration file `config.yaml`.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model should be organized as follows:

```
data/
    train/
        images/
        labels/
    val/
        images/
        labels/
```

Ensure that your dataset includes annotated house plans with the elements you wish to detect.

## Model Training

To train the model, use the following command:

```bash
python train.py --data /path/to/your/dataset --epochs 100 --batch-size 16 --img-size 640
```

This will start the training process using the specified dataset and configuration.

## Inference

To run inference on new house plans and interpret them, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Results

The results of the house plan interpretation will be displayed in real-time and saved to the specified output directory.
